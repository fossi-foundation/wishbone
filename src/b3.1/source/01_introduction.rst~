Introduction
============

The WISHBONE System-on-Chip (SoC) Interconnection Architecture for Portable IP Cores is a flexible design methodology for use with semiconductor IP cores.
Its purpose is to foster design reuse by alleviating System-on-Chip integration problems.
This is accomplished by creating a common interface between IP cores.
This improves the portability and reliability of the system, and results in faster time-to-market for the end user.

Previously, IP cores used non-standard interconnection schemes that made them difficult to inte-
grate. This required the creation of custom glue logic to connect each of the cores together. By
adopting a standard interconnection scheme, the cores can be integrated more quickly and easily
by the end user.

This specification can be used for soft core, firm core or hard core IP. Since firm and hard cores
are generally conceived as soft cores, the specification is written from that standpoint.
This specification does not require the use of specific development tools or target hardware. Fur-
thermore, it is fully compliant with virtually all logic synthesis tools. However, the examples
presented in the specification do use the VHDL hardware description language. These are pre-
sented only as a convenience to the reader, and should be readily understood by users of other
hardware description languages (such as Verilogï›š). Schematic based tools can also be used.
The WISHBONE interconnect is intended as a general purpose interface. As such, it defines the
standard data exchange between IP core modules. It does not attempt to regulate the application-
specific functions of the IP core.

The WISHBONE architects were strongly influenced by three factors. First, there was a need for
a good, reliable System-on-Chip integration solution. Second, there was a need for a common
interface specification to facilitate structured design methodologies on large project teams.
Third, they were impressed by the traditional system integration solutions afforded by micro-
computer buses such as PCI bus and VMEbus.

In fact, the WISHBONE architecture is analogous to a microcomputer bus in that that they both:
(a) offer a flexible integration solution that can be easily tailored to a specific application; (b)
offer a variety of bus cycles and data path widths to solve various system problems; and (c) al-
low products to be designed by a
