Cited Patent References
=======================

This chapter contains a partial list of the patents that have been
reviewed by the WISHBONE steward and others. In the opinion of the
steward, the WISHBONE System-on-Chip (SoC) Interconnection
Architecture for Portable IP Cores does not infringe on any of these
patents.  However, the possibility exists that an integrated circuit
device designed to the WISHBONE specification could infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others. The user assumes all
responsibility for determining if their WISHBONE design infringes on
the rights of others. All of these documents contain information
relevant to SoC design and integration. Noteworthy patents are marked
with a '(*)'.

This list is maintained for three reasons. First, a public domain
specification canâ€™t depend on patented ideas (unless permission to
use the patent is obtained). This is the list of documents that have
been reviewed to see if WISHBONE infringes on any known
patents. Second, it provides a starting point for IC designers and
other researchers who need to know if a specific SoC design infringes
on the rights of others. Third, the patent database is a wonderful
place to learn how other people have solved similar SoC
problems. Patent documents are very good in this regard, as they must
fully describe how to reproduce an invention.
